# Neural Networks
The python notebooks show some of the stock prediction techniques using
 - Recurrent Neural Networks
 -  Linear regularisations using Lasso and Ridge regressions
 -  Batch and stochastic gradient descent methods

It also shows some work in replicating 2019 research paper on stock-industry returns using machine learning approach by 
David Rapach, Jack Strauss, Jun Tu and Guofu Zhou.
